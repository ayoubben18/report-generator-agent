# Report Generator Agent Workflow Rule

This rule defines the step-by-step workflow for the report generator agent, as visualized in the provided diagram. Each step should be implemented as a discrete module or function in the codebase.

---

## Workflow Steps

1. **Task**
   - Start with a task definition or input.

2. **Grab User Approved Tasks**
   - Retrieve tasks that have been approved by the user for processing.

3. **Call MCP Servers for Knowledge Gathering**
   - For each task, identify knowledge gaps and call the appropriate MCP servers:
     - **Tavily**: For general knowledge and broad topic research.
     - **Context7**: For library and framework documentation (with reference support).
     - **MCP GitHub/Exa**: For parsing GitHub repositories and extracting LLM-ready code/data.

4. **Generate Knowledge Paragraphs**
   - Synthesize the gathered information into relevant, well-structured paragraphs.

5. **Identify Diagram/Image Needs**
   - Analyze the generated paragraphs to determine which sections require diagrams or images (e.g., class diagrams, backend architectures, flow diagrams, sequential diagrams). Use Claude or similar LLMs for this analysis.

6. **Convert Diagrams to Images**
   - For each identified diagram, determine how to convert it into an image format suitable for inclusion in the report.

7. **Build LaTeX PDF Report**
   - Assemble the paragraphs and images into a LaTeX document and generate the final PDF report.

## Notes
- Each step should be modular to allow for independent testing and future extension.
- Use the appropriate MCP server for each knowledge type as per the workspace rules.
- Diagram/image generation should be automated as much as possible.
- The workflow should be extensible for additional knowledge sources or output formats.
