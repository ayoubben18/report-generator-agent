This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and configured with [SST](https://sst.dev) for serverless deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended package manager)
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials

### Development

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, add the env vars from `env.template` and hit `pnpm run dev` and you're good to go.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
